This simple library provides tools for work with private and public RSA keys as [JWK](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517).
The Library allows generating, save and load crypto keys pair based on RSA algorithm. A JWK keys usually use asymmetric encryption and publish public keys (using JWKS) to validate the JWT tokens they issue.
A public key may be placed at different service or server for validate JWT signature.

The Library writen in Go and can be easy embed to golang projects where this feature is need.
