### JSON Web Key (JWK) tool 
This library provides tools for work with private and public RSA keys as [JWK](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517).
The Library allows generating, save and load crypto keys pair based on RSA algorithm. A JWK keys usually use asymmetric encryption and publish public keys (using JWKS) to validate the JWT tokens they issue.
A public key may be placed at different service or server for validate JWT signature.
